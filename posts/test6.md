date: "February 12th, 2025"
link: "/infrastructure/vlafuse"
shortDescription: "Fusing diverse data streams for VLA robustness."
longExcerpt: "We introduce a multimodal data fusion framework for Vision-Language-Action models, integrating visual, linguistic, and sensory data to enhance generalization across unseen environments. By aligning cross-modal embeddings, our method improves VLA task adaptability by 28%, particularly in cluttered and dynamic settings."
