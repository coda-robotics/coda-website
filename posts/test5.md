title: "Context-Aware Data Pruning for VLAs"
date: "February 5th, 2025"
link: "/infrastructure/vlaprune"
shortDescription: "Targeted data pruning to optimize VLA training."
longExcerpt: "We developed a context-aware data pruning technique for Vision-Language-Action models that identifies and removes redundant or low-impact training samples based on contextual relevance. This approach reduces training dataset size by 20% while maintaining performance, accelerating VLA convergence in real-world robotic tasks."
