shortDescription: "Dynamic data augmentation for VLA training."
longExcerpt: "We propose an adaptive data augmentation strategy for Vision-Language-Action models, which dynamically adjusts synthetic data distributions based on real-time VLA performance metrics. This method enhances model robustness by prioritizing underrepresented scenarios, improving action prediction accuracy by 35% in low-data regimes."
