shortDescription: "Policy behavior patterns across reasoning-driven VLA data."
link: "infrastructure/pdist"
longExcerpt: "We introduce Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (ECoT) for VLAs, in which we train VLAs to perform multiple steps of reasoning about plans, sub-tasks, motions, and visually grounded features like object bounding boxes and end effector positions, before predicting the robot action. We design a scalable pipeline for generating synthetic training data for ECoT on large robot datasets."
